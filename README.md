# Mutfunc: SARS-CoV-2 Frontend

This repository contains the code for the Mutfunc: SARS-CoV-2 Mutfunc website.
The project has been published in PAPER, where the methods and dataset are described.
The pipeline code is in a separate [repository](https://github.com/allydunham/mutfunc_sars_cov_2).

The site is made with [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/), using
[PV - Protein Viewer](https://biasmv.github.io/pv/) and [React MSA Viewer](https://github.com/plotly/react-msa-viewer) to display proteins and sequences.

The project uses three main branches:

* master - The most recent WIP updates and features
* dev - Version currently being run on the test server
* prod - Version currently on the live server
